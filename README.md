# xen-host-allbackup
XEN / LVM Host Auto-Backup for Xen DomU (live and online)

It could be used to snapshot backup any kind of LVM.

This Software provides easy automatic snapshot backups of LVM Volumes of hosted VMs. 

Currently it uses backup-manager to create and manage the tarballs, but could be modified to provide other kind of backup tools or just any suitable archivers up to rsync. If there is any real interest, i would add this.
